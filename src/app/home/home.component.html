    <p>Welcome to the 4.20.2019.1 Update! Here's what we've changed:</p>

    <p><b>UI</b><br>There is a new UI! This new UI will help us bring more features faster in the future!</p>
    <p><b>Teams</b><br>Teams are now active. When you setup a session you can now set the teams and the scording type. Both the team's score and the player's score are now displayed on the session screen.</p>
    <p><b>Scoring</b><br>Scores for each session are displayed on the session screen. This will also rank each member and team listed!</p>

    <p><b>Whats Next</b><br>Data Visuliazation is incoming. We plan to release a scoreboard and multiple graphs on both the session and the course. The session graphs will display the stats for each player and team. The Course graphs will display your personal scores at that course.</p>
